# Read committed snapshot isolation level in sql 

- Read committed snapshot isolation level in SQL server

--- 
- Read commited snapshot isolation level is not a different isolation level.
- It is a different way of implementing Read committed isolation level.
- One problem we have with read committed isolation level is that 
- it blocks the transaction if 
- it is trying to read the data 
- that another tranasaction is updating at the same time

- Read commited has default behavior when update data by 1st Transaction
- block the another transaction
